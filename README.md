#About

Addlibs allows people to crowd-write stories in chunks of 40 characters. The homepage presents a user with a random story from the database, as well as the last chunk that was added to that story. The user can add up to 40 characters to end of the story, based off of what he or she has seen so far. The whole story is then presented to the user and he or she will have the option to contribute to another random story or to create a new story.

#Tools
Addlibs was created with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, and MongoDB
