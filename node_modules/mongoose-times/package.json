  "readme": "mongoose-times\n==============\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/nicholasconfer/mongoose-times.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nicholasconfer/mongoose-times)\n\nPlugin for [Mongoose](https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose) that adds `created` and `lastUpdated` date properties to your Schema.  The property names `created` and `lastUpdated` can be customized and the properties automatically generate timestamps when saving a document in mongoose.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install mongoose-times\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe examples below create a message model that will include `created` and `lastUpdated` properties in their schema.  Those properties will have timestamps that are automatically generated and updated when you save your document.\n\n### [CoffeeScript](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script) Example\n```CoffeeScript\nmongoose = require \"mongoose\"\ntimestamps = require \"mongoose-times\"\n\nExampleSchema = new Schema {}\nExampleSchema.plugin timestamps\n\nexample = mongoose.model \"Example\", ExampleSchema\n```\nIf you'd like to change the name of the key properties in your document just set them when calling the plugin method with the `created` and `lastUpdated` options\n```\nExampleSchema.plugin timestamps { created: \"created_at\", lastUpdated: \"updated_at\" }\n```\n\n### JavaScript Example\n```JavaScript\nvar mongoose = require(\"mongoose\"),\n    timestamps = require(\"mongoose-times\");\n\nvar ExampleSchema = new Schema({});\nExampleSchema.plugin(timestamps);\n\nvar example = mongoose.model(\"Example\", ExampleSchema);\n```\n\nAgain, if you'd like to change the name of the key properties in your document just then when calling the plugin method with the `created` and `lastUpdated` options\n```\nExampleSchema.plugin(timestamps, { created: \"created_at\", lastUpdated: \"updated_at\" });\n```\n\n## MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 [Nicholas Confer](https://github.com/nicholasconfer)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
